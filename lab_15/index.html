	<p>So to fill up this page I will write about snowboarding. The best
	part about riding is the creativity of it. Learning the basics of pushing,
	turning, carving, ollies, and navigating is important. After
 	overcoming that hump and finding a new frame of mind and understanding
	the basic mechanics of shredding. Once you get a better understanind of
	the manuevering part, then it's all about creativity and pushing your skills.
	For example, I hit the mini half-pipe a few times today and each run I felt
	more confidence and better control. But of course I needed to warm-up with
	some steeper terrain riding. Having fun and taking small risks, I am able
	to express more creativity the more comfortable I become. Then I hit the park for the
	first time in a long time. Snowboarding, like most sports, is mental. Accomplishing
	that goal of hitting a rail or riding down a black diamond run is all on yourself
	and nobody can help you get better more than yourself. The best way to get good at something
	like snowboaring, is to keep doing it and just send it!
