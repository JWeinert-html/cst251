		<h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The lab is about styling block elements. For this lab I styled
		my content, body, and image. I gave the body a nice solid blue background,
		the content has a softer blue background color with a navy border.
		And I used the content id to edit the colors of the text and shadows. I also
	 	changed the style of the image using div id="movie-poster" and added a
		fun yellow background to give a striking composition. And finally I
		gave the homepage link at the bottom a bit more snazzy style. </p>
		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>I had trouble styling my image and adjusting the size. I had confused
		the difference between div id tags and elements, and which was to be styled
		and which didn't need the all of the styled specifications (such as
		background color, borders, etc.). </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>These are the results.</p>
