	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>Using the basic file structure and the CSS we have learned so far,
	I made a site with style, structure and organization. Then, using slightly
	more advanced techniques, I will style my sidebar div and the links div to stick
	to a specific part of the page.</p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>No problem!</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Here are the results.</p>

		<h3>Sidebar Stuff:</h3>
		<p>I am Janelle Weinert, I love to explore. Whether that is camping,
		hiking, backpacking, snowboarding, nordic skiing or just travelling
		to a new place I am down. This summer I plan to take	more backpacking
		and camping trips in my hometown. In the past I have taken many hikes with
		family and friends around the Eastern	Sierras. Including hikes to McCleod Lake,
		ArrowHead Lake, Starkweather Lake, Garnet Lake, and Thousand Island Lake.
		<br>
		In general, I have really grown to love hiking and spending more time outdoors.
		When I was a mere child, I found it boring and strenuous to hike excruciatingly
		long trails. Now, I find any excuse to grab a backpack with a lunch, jacket, water
		and go for a short/long hike. Sometimes I go by myself, setting a quick pace and enjoying
		the bueacolic silence. Typically, I take a hike with my mom or a friend who likes hiking
		more than I do. And we set off into the wild and unpredictable woods.
		<br>
		But for now I will keep exploring Big Sur trails and potentially some campgrounds.
		The reason I love hiking so much is because of the silence, the tranquil prescence of
    nature and all of its intricate details. Details that are everchanging with the breeze.
		Being out in nature helps me think clearly, sometimes I sketch while I'm outside.
		Hiking is also an excuse to get good excercise and avoid doing homework.</p>
