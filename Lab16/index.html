	<h1>Lab 16</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge is to create more CSS stylesheet effects. Some examples:
		more backgrounds, transistions, animation, and columns. Therefore I used
	 	some old images from Death Valley sand dunes to as a background image and
		some additional small images. It was a bit glitchy with various transistions
		overlapping. Finally, I added the animation effect to a tumbleweed.png that
		I found on google. I will give it more of a "tumble" effect later.</p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>The first problem that I ran into is the object-fit and transition break.
			I initially had resized an image with object-fit, then later thought it would
			be cool to add a transition so when the user hovers over the image, it becomes
			larger. But it didn't work at all, and I refered to stackoverflow, apparently
			object-fit breaks transitions. And I found an alternative solution.
			Then I had another issue with the smoothness of the transition. With more images,
			I decided to have the images not only change size but also move to another part of
			the page. However, the image on the right has an awkard glitching issue everytime
			I hover the mouse over it, and thus I have not resolved the problem.
			And another problem that was too time-consuming. The animation, I eventually
			was able to get the tumbleed to move, however I would like to spend more time
			to figure out how to make it tumble rather than slide left to right.</p>
