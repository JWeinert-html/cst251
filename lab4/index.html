<h1>Subject</h1>
	<p>File Transfer.Test local files and then upload to the server.</p>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p>After comminting to master and pushing changes onto Github, the site was
	not updating very rapidly. In other words the modifications that I made were
	not updating until 30 minutes later.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>The lab2 and lab3 pages ran smoothly. My partner and I worked side-by-side
	working together to brainstorm and solve any oncoming issues. Any issues that
	we encountered were very minor. We tested some files, then uploaded on Github.</p>
