			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>For this assignment, I came up with some rough
			sketches to help me brainstorm some ideas for the layout of
			my group's site. There are a total of 5 sheets with 3 different pages
			depicted.</p>
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>One problem that I had was coming up with different ideas, mostly
			because our group already had a very specific layout in mind. But with a pencil
			and some paper, I felt a bit more freedom to come up with some alternative ideas.</p>
			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>My rough sketches are below. </p>
