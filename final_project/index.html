			<div id="santa-cruz-content">
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>Sant Cruz is hom to the The Santa Cruz BoardWalk, which is the oldest
					standing amusement park in California, having been opened in 1907.
					The boardwalk has been the
					backdrop of many films including the 2019 film, “Us”. With an Oscar
					nomination directed by Jordan Peele and lead actress Lupita Nyong’o.
					They shot on East Cliff Drive for three days in September of 2018.
					Some other movies filmed at the boardwalk are “Bumblebee”, “Chasing
					Mavericks”, “Dangerous Minds”, “The Lost Boys” and “Sudden Impact”.
					Scenes were also filmed on the UC Santa Cruz campus and Main Beach.</p>
				<p>While filming "Us" Jordan Peele said there's a nod to “The Lost
					Boys” in the opening flashback sequence of "Us". The scene takes
					place in 1986, which is the year before the “The Lost Boys" was
					reassessed in 1987. In the movie “Us” the young girl walks down
					the Boardwalk, and her mother gestures toward the carousel, saying
					“They’re shooting a movie over there.”</p>
				<p>Joel Schumacher directed "The Lost Boys" featured Jason Patric and
					Corey Haim as the brothers and main characters of the movie. Santa
					Cruz only allowed filming to take place there if the town was
					renamed in the film to Santa Carla because Santa Cruz did not want
					to be known as the “murder capital of the world”. Santa Cruz
					locations for the film include the Santa Cruz Boardwalk, Atlantis
					Fantasyworld Comic Book Shop, Santa Cruz Wharf, Pogonip Country Club,
					and off Interstate 5 on the Magic Mountain Parkway in the Iron Horse
					Trailhead trestle bridge.</p>

				<h3>History of the Monterey Bay Aquarium</h3>
				<p>On July 7, 1916 Knut Hovden opened the largest sardine cannery
					on Cannery Row. Unable to market enough, the Hovden cannery closed
					in 1973. By November 1977, plans for the world-class aquarium began to form.
					October 20th, 1984, the Aquarim opened its doors to 10,681 visitors on the first day.
					April 1986, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was filmed here at the Aquarium.
					On October 20, 2019 the Aquarium celebrated 35 years!

					However, some CGI modifactions were made in order to portray a fictional humpback
					whale enclosure at the Aquarium.</p>
					<h3>Fun Facts</h3>

				<h3>Big Little Lies</h3>
				<p>This HBO series stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley,
					Laura Dern, and Zoë Kravitz as five women in Monterey, California,
					who become embroiled in a murder investigation. Most locations were shot at the actual,
					physical, location along the Fisherman's Warf and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Lover's Point,
					and parts of Big Sur etc. However, the set of the cafe was remade in Hollywood
					in order to control things such as weather, lighting, crowds, etc.</p>

			<h1> Carmel </h1>
			<div id="carmel-content">
				<div id="location-info">
					<h2>Info</h2>
					<p>Welcome to Carmel, also known as Carmel-By-The-Sea! This little
						village lies on the Carmel River and Carmel Bay, and is only less
						than 15 minutes away from Monterey. Carmel is dominated by tourist
						attrations and activities, such as the 17 Mile Drive to Pacific
						Grove, eating at one of a kind restaurants, or just relax and enjoy
						the views.</p>
					<h2> Fun Facts </h2>
					<h3>Former Mayor</h3>
					<p>Dirty Harry. Gran Torino. Unforgiven. What do these movies and
						Carmel have in common with each other? You guessed it. Clint Eastwood!
						Clint Eastwood was elected for mayor of Carmel and ran one term from
						1986 to 1988.</p>
					<h3>Chain Restaurants</h3>
					<p> Do you want to go eat as a one of a kind shop for coffee,
						sandwiches, or even some wine? In Carmel, there are no chain
						restaurants! Head to a small business or family owned shop
						to enjoy fine-dinging and casual cuisine.</p>
					<h3>Banning of Shoes?</h3>
					<p>In Carmel, you're more likely to wear some comfortable
						shoes or sandals since you're going to be walking a lot. However,
						you're more less likely to be wearing high heels or see people
						in high heels. Why? Because high heels are banned in Carmel! The muncipal
						cofe of Carmel bans high heels that are more than 2 inches in height
						and less than one square inch. If you wanted to wear high heels,
						supposedly, you're supposed to get a permit at City Hall.
						Don't worry, it's free of charge.</p>

				<h2>Big Sur</h2>
				<p>Renowned worldwide for its natural features and relatively pristine scenery</p>
			</div>
			<div id="big-sur-content">
				<h3>Info</h3>
				<p>Big Sur is located along the Scenic Highway One approximately 150 miles
					south of San Francisco and 300 miles north of Los Angeles.
					Historically, the name Big Sur was derived from that unexplored and
					unmapped wilderness area that lies along the coast south of Monterey.
					It was simply called ‘El Sur Grande’, The Big South. Today, Big Sur
					refers to that 90-mile stretch of rugged and awesomely beautiful coastline.
					On one side is the majestic Santa Lucia Mountains and on the other, the rocky Pacific Coast.
				</p>
				<h3>Where is that stunning intro view?
					The Bixby Bridge</h3>
				<p>The stunning arch bridge featured in the show’s opening credits
					is actually located in Big Sur, 18 miles south of Monterey.
					the Bixby Creek Bridge, built in 1931, curves above a canyon
					in Big Sur, and is known for its unique architectural design.
				</p>
				<img src="./img/big-intro.gif" alt="intro">
				<p>Completed in 1932 for just over $200,000,
					it is one of the highest bridges in the world. It soars 260 feet above
					the bottom of a steep canyon carved by Bixby Creek.
					Today (as always) the bridge is a favorite attraction for photographers,
					from professionals to those in search of the ultimate depth-of-field selfie.
					But whether you are snapping away or not, be sure to take advantage
					of the multiple viewpoints.
				</p>
				<h3>Big Little Lies</h3>
				<p>Big Little Lies is an American drama television series based on
					the 2014 novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty.
					Big Little Lies stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley,
					Laura Dern, and Zoë Kravitz as five women in Monterey, California,
					who become embroiled in a murder investigation.
					<iframe src="https://youtu.be/8XgMvMpvCFI?autoplay=1&mute=1" title="Big Little Lies Trailer" width="420" height="380">
					</iframe>
					Several scenes were filmed on location in the Monterey Peninsula,
					Big Sur, Pacific Grove, and Carmel Highlands. Especially the intro of
					this show is showing the famous bridge of the big sur.
					"Big Little Lies" weaves a darkly comedic tale of murder and mischief
					in the tranquil beachfront town of Monterey, Calif. Amidst doting moms,
					successful husbands, beautiful children, and stunning homes exists
					a community fueled by rumors and divided into haves and have-nots,
					exposing fractured relationships between husbands and wives, parents
					and children, and friends and neighbors. Told through the eyes of
					three mothers -- Madeline, Celeste and Jane -- the series' narrative
					explores society's myths regarding perfection and its romanticization
					of marriage, sex, parenting and friendship. Reese Witherspoon,
					Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley star as the three prominent "mothers of Monterey."
				</p>
				<h3>Big Sur Attractions</h3>
				<img src="./img/big-sur.jpg" alt="bixby bridge">
				<p>besides sightseeing from the highway, Big Sur offers hiking and
					outdoor activities. There are a large number of state and federal
					lands and parks, including McWay Falls at Julia Pfeiffer Burns
					State Park, one of only two waterfalls in California that plunge
					directly into the ocean. The waterfall is located near the foundation
					of a grand stone cliffside house built in 1940 by Lathrop and Hélène
					Hooper Brown that was the region's first electrified home.
					However, parking is very limited and usually unavailable on summer
					weekends and holidays.<br>
					Another notable landmark is Point Sur Lightstation, the only
					complete nineteenth century lighthouse complex open to the public in California.<br>
					The Ventana Wildlife Center near Andrew Molera State Park features
					a free Discovery Center that enables visitors to learn about the
					California Condor recovery program and other wildlife.<br>
					There's also a special event in Big Sur. The Big Sur International
					Marathon is an annual marathon that begins south of Pfeiffer Big
					Sur State Park and ends at the Crossroads Shopping Center in
					Carmel-by-the-Sea. The marathon was established in 1986 and
					attracts about 4,500 participants annually. Civic leaders in Big
					Sur stage a run each year in October to raise funds for the Big
					Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade and the Big Sur Health Center. Since
					the race, known as the Big Sur River Run, was founded in 1971,
					more than $1,025,104 has been donated to the two organizations.</p>
				<h3>Fun Fact: Folk Festival</h3>
				<p>The Big Sur Folk Festival was held from 1964 to 1971.
					It began unintentionally when Nancy Carlen, a friend of singer Joan Baez,
					organized a weekend seminar at the Esalen Institute in June 1964
					titled "The New Folk Music". On Sunday afternoon,
					they invited all the neighbors for a free, open performance.
					This became the first festival. The festival was held yearly on
					the grounds of the Esalen Institute, except for 1970,
					when it was held at the Monterey County Fairgrounds.
					Even when well-known acts like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young or
					the Beach Boys performed, the event was purposefully kept small
					with no more than a few thousand in attendance.</p>
