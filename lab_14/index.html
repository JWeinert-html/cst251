	<h1>Lab 14: Typography II</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>I found another site to forge. And I put in my best effort. I went with
	something that was simplistic and cool. With bold numbers of the year 1961
	and a stunning photo with bright lense flares, I found an inspiring site
	to mimic.</p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	The problems that I had were placement, trying to get the paragraph to be closer
	to the year vertically, was nearly impossible. Until I googled the question and
	looked at StackOverflow for the answer, margins! Then I ran into another issue
	the image needs to have an image of a sun, but with the sun located between 9
	and 6. So I fidged with the background image size until I finally used my screencap
	as a way to measure the size. And it worked. But it's still not perfect. I may change
	the image I chose.
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<iframe id="fake" src="fake.html"></iframe>
	<link><a href="fake.html" alt="fake-html">Fake Site Link</a></link>
