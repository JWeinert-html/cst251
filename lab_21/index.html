	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>The challenge with this assignment was trying to elaborate my previous drawings
	with more detauls but also with more intention behind my concepts. Before, I was
  merely trying to come up with more ideas, but now it is a bit more challenging
	to create a wireframe that depicts both my idea and looks like a typical site.</p>
	<h2>Problem</h2>
	<p>There was no major problem, just rushing to get this assignment done before tommorrow
	morning.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Polly: Likes the map with the stars, movie reels. And she also likes the movie
		reel middle sketch with Big Sur and the sidebar nav. Hyeonseo: She is inspired
		by the reels and the Monterey fog. A concept which takes the images, covered
		in fog initially, then reveals them slowly transitions to reveal a clear image of the location.
		Caden: They liked the reels and mentioned that they were planning to do a similar concept.
		And the Monterey fog idea was good too. Everyone is inspired by the movie reels and they
		like the old Monterey Foggy images.
		<br>So I elaborated on those concepts. The results of my
		redone sketches are below. Please take a look.</p>
