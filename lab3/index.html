	<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p>While completing this lab, I found myself returning to the instructions
			to check if I was inputing my code correctly.Utilizing the provided example
			screenshots online, I was able to copy the formatting style of the list of
			labs on my site.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Completing the lab was fairly easy, as much of the tasks were done
					before, in the previous lab as a bonus. Making new lab directories
					such as lab7,lab8,lab9,and lab10 was a quick process. And creating
					this html doc has been good, I simply follow the examples	provided.
					However, I am unfamiliar with CSS, so the most challenging aspect is
					creating a CSS stylesheet that I have yet to complete.</p>
